Module::Starter::PBP version 0.0.3

This module implements a simple approach to creating modules and their support
files, based on the Module::Starter approach. Module::Starter needs to be
installed before this module can be used.

When used as a Module::Starter plugin, this module allows you to specify a
simple directory of templates which are filled in with module-specific
information, and thereafter form the basis of your new module.

The default templates that this module initially provides are based on
the recommendations in the book "Perl Best Practices" (O'Reilly, 2005).
